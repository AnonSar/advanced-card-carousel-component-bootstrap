## Motivation Behind Development </>

A few weeks ago, while working on one of my side projects I felt the need of such a Bootstrap component where the user can
display cards in a single slide of carousel component. Afte searching online for a while, I came across Multi Item Carousel
Component on [mdbootstrap.com](https://mdbootstrap.com/) which was exactly what I needed needed but unfortunately it required
the user to pay some :dollar:. Me being tight on budget, couldn't afford to pay for one thus decided to develop one of my own. So here it is, a carousel card component for free of cost.

**Feel free to use this component in your project !**
